This package could just as well have been named yamisc (Yet Another MISCellaneous package). It contains various miscellaneous utility functions that the  author found useful at the time. You are free to use it, but YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).

Version 0.2.0 is developed built with R 3.5, older versions of R may or may not work (they probably will).
