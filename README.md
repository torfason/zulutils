## Miscellaneous utility functions that the author found useful

This package contains various miscellaneous utility functions that the
author found useful at the time. You are free to use it, but YMMV (Your
Mileage May Vary).

Versions 0.3.5 and higher are developed with R 4.1 and rely on the new
pipe operator (`|>`), so older versions of R will not work.
